# Draw CNN

This is a demo for drawing CNN architecture. 

In order to draw your architecture, you only need to type your network as the demo code shows. The code could be read as name_of_layer (height,width,number of filters). Now, we only support CNN's four types of operations because other operations would not change the size of output in each layer. 

If you have any question or advise, please feel free to contact me at hl3099@columbia.edu.
