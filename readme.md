# Draw CNN

This is a demo for drawing CNN architecture. 

In order to draw your architecture, you only need to type your network as the demo code shows. The code could be read as name_of_layer (height,width,number of filters). Now, we only support CNN's four types of operations because other operations would not change the size of output in each layer.
